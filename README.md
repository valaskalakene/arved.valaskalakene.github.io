A simple and elegant tax free cashout into crypto service for businesses with VAT#.

An EU company provides an invoice for a suitable service (marketing, sales lead generation, etc) and sends the amount minus comission (6%) to a provided crypto address(es). 
Added bonus is non-KYC, clean BTC/crypto.
Can be a repeat business with monthly volume of low (to mid) 5 figures. Depends mostly on your revenue. For example more than 5% of turnover to marketing is not advisable.

Can be used to cash out dividends, pay emplyees, etc.
